block-the-eu-cookie-shit-list
=============================

Adblock / Adblock plus filter list for blocking cookie notifications

Add `https://raw.github.com/r4vi/block-the-eu-cookie-shit-list/master/filterlist.txt` to your filter 
subscriptions if you want to block "EU cookie law" notifications and popups. 

Please submit pull-reqs to filterlist.txt and I'll merge them in as soon as I can.
Tested in Chrome (Adblock Plus) but should work on Firefox too.
